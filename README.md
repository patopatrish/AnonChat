# AnonChat 🌌

**AnonChat** is a **Stellar-based anonymous communication platform** that allows users to create groups and chat freely with strangers — **without revealing identity**. Access is powered by **Web3 wallet authentication**, ensuring privacy, decentralization, and user sovereignty.

> Speak freely. Stay anonymous. Powered by Stellar.

## 🚀 What is AnonChat?

AnonChat is a decentralized, privacy-first chat application where:

* Users **connect using a Web3 wallet**
* No personal data, email, or phone number is required
* Users can **create or join anonymous groups**

* Identity is never exposed — not even to us

The platform leverages **Stellar blockchain primitives** to ensure transparency, decentralization, and trustless authentication.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Node.js >= 18.x
* pnpm (recommended)
* [Supabase account](https://supabase.com)

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/your-username/anonchat.git
cd AnonChat
pnpm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials

# 3. Run database migrations in Supabase SQL Editor
# scripts/001_create_profiles.sql
# scripts/002_create_profile_trigger.sql
# scripts/003_room_members_and_removal_votes.sql  (for wallet-based removal voting)

# 4. Start dev server
pnpm dev
```

### Testing wallet-based removal voting

**Full runbook:** See [docs/RUN-VOTE-REMOVE.md](docs/RUN-VOTE-REMOVE.md) for step-by-step run and verify instructions.

1. **Apply the migration**  
   Run `scripts/003_room_members_and_removal_votes.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor so `room_members`, `room_removal_votes`, and `check_removal_threshold` exist.

2. **API smoke test** (Node ≥18, dev server on Node ≥20):  
   With the dev server running (`pnpm dev`), in another terminal:
   ```bash
   pnpm run test:vote-remove
   ```
   This checks that unauthenticated requests get 401 and invalid requests get 400.

3. **Manual UI test**  
   Open `/chat`, select a room, click the ⋮ (More) button in the header. The “Room members & voting” dialog should open; without auth you’ll see “No members yet, or you need to sign in.” After signing in and joining a room (e.g. by sending a message), you can vote to remove another member; when a majority votes, they are removed and can no longer send messages in that room.

### Environment Variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=AnonChat
```
